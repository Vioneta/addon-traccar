Modern GPS Tracking Platform.

## About

[Traccar][traccar] is a modern GPS Tracking Platform, which is now available
as a Vioneta Agro add-on and allows you to run your GPS Tracking software
without any cloud.

Traccar supports more protocols and device models than any other GPS tracking
system on the market, straight from your Vioneta Agro instance. You can
select GPS trackers from a variety of vendors from low-cost Chinese models to
high-end quality brands.

Traccar also has native mobile apps available for Android and iOS platforms
so that you can track those as well. AND! With the Vioneta Agro `traccar`
integration (introduced in 0.83) the data in Traccar will be sent back into
your Vioneta Agro instance as well.
